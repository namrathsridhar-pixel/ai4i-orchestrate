# Interoperability

### Interoperability

AI4I-Orchestrate is designed as a modular runtime layer that interoperates with adjacent systems across the Language AI lifecycle. It exposes well-defined APIs, data models, and feedback interfaces that allow it to integrate cleanly into broader ecosystems without creating tight coupling.

Interoperability ensures that AI4I-Orchestrate can function as a shared runtime capability across domains, organizations, and platforms.

#### Integration with Data Contribution Systems

AI4I-Orchestrate generates structured feedback and error signals based on real-world usage and quality monitoring. These signals can be consumed by data contribution and validation systems to drive targeted data collection and correction workflows.

This integration enables a closed feedback loop where runtime performance gaps inform data improvement and model retraining.

#### Integration with Model Registries and Catalogs

AI4I-Orchestrate can integrate with model registries and metadata catalogs to retrieve information about available models, including:

* Model identifiers and versions
* Supported languages and domains
* Licensing and compliance metadata

This allows model routing and policy decisions to be informed by authoritative model metadata rather than application-level configuration.

#### Integration with Training and Retraining Pipelines

Runtime telemetry and feedback generated by AI4I-Orchestrate can be consumed by model training and retraining pipelines. This enables:

* Identification of underperforming language or domain segments
* Creation of targeted evaluation or challenge datasets
* Deployment of improved model versions back into the runtime

This integration supports continuous improvement without requiring changes to application integrations.

#### Integration with Sectoral Platforms and DPIs

AI4I-Orchestrate is designed to be consumed by sectoral platforms and Digital Public Infrastructure systems across domains such as health, education, agriculture, justice, and public services.

By acting as a shared runtime layer, AI4I-Orchestrate allows multiple sectoral systems to access Language AI capabilities consistently while adhering to centralized governance and policy controls.

***

AI4I-Orchestrate’s interoperability enables Language AI to operate as a reusable, ecosystem-level capability, connecting data, models, runtime execution, and applications through well-defined interfaces.
