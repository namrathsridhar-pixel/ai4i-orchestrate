# Data & Control Models

### Data & Control Models

#### Usage Event

Captures operational metadata for every request, including tenant, API type, language, domain, model used, latency, error status, and cost units.

#### Policy Rule

Defines governance logic for routing and access control, specifying allowed models, languages, domains, SLA class, and throughput limits.

These models enable consistent metering, auditing, and governance across the platform.
