## Introduction

Modern multilingual systems rely on Language AI models such as Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), Large
Language Models (LLMs), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). As these models
are adopted across multiple applications, departments, and domains, managing them
directly at the application level leads to fragmentation, governance gaps, and
operational complexity.

AI4I-Orchestrate addresses this challenge by acting as a unified runtime orchestration
and governance layer for Language AI. Instead of applications integrating with
individual models or vendors, all Language AI requests are routed through a single,
policy-controlled, and observable control plane.

AI4I-Orchestrate ensures that Language AI can be deployed as reliable digital
infrastructure by enforcing consistent access control, intelligent routing, usage
metering, quality monitoring, and continuous feedback loops. It provides the
foundational runtime backbone required to operate Language AI at national or
ecosystem scale.
