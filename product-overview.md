## Product Overview

AI4I-Orchestrate is a Digital Public Good that provides a unified runtime layer for
serving and governing Language AI capabilities. It exposes a stable and consistent
API surface for speech, text, translation, and multimodal language services while
abstracting the complexity of underlying models and infrastructure.

The platform enables organizations to:
- Serve multiple Language AI models through a single gateway
- Dynamically select models based on language, domain, cost, and performance
- Enforce tenant-level policies, quotas, and service-level objectives
- Capture detailed telemetry for observability, billing, and governance
- Feed real-world performance gaps back into data and model improvement cycles

AI4I-Orchestrate functions as the execution engine of the AI4Inclusion ecosystem,
turning trained models into governed, scalable, and continuously improving public
infrastructure.
