# Overview

AI4I-Orchestrate is the runtime orchestration and governance layer for Language AI systems. It provides a unified control plane for serving speech, text, translation, and multimodal language models through a consistent API surface.

AI4I-Orchestrate centralizes authentication, policy enforcement, model routing, execution, metering, and observability behind a single runtime layer. This allows applications to consume Language AI capabilities without directly integrating individual models or vendors.

The platform is designed to operate at ecosystem or national scale, enabling multi-tenant usage, governed access, and continuous improvement based on real-world runtime signals.
